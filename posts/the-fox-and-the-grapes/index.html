                <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox&rsquo;s mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
<p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>
<p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</p>
